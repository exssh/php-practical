# PHP Practical

> Collection of resources on learning and enhancing php related understanding with mixed guided articles and self practice project development.


The collection aims to provide modularize resources on learning php from the very first stage up until developing a well written, maintenable and secured `php-based` application.

While most of the articles are composed from my own understanding through implementing php on projects with various sizes and scopes, it can be better with future fixes or enhacements from you.
